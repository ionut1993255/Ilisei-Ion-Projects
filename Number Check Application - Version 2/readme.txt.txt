1. I created a web application with 2 buttons: Check and Reset.
2. When we press the button "Check" a random number between 1 and 30 will be displayed instead of the paragraph "?".
3. When the number is even the color of the number will be red and will be displayed a message bellow that says that number is even. 
4. When the number is odd the color of the number will be blue and will be displayed a message bellow that says that number is odd. 
5. When we press the button "Reset" will be displayed the paragrapf "?" with the original color and a message bellow that says to press the button "Check".
